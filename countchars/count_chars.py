# Create a function that takes the filepath (e.g. "da_vinci_code.txt") as an input, reads the given file, and counts the occurences of 0, 1 and x characters in it.
# The function should return a dictionary in which the searched characters are the keys and the number of their occurences are the values.
# Use the uploaded da_vinci_code.txt file in this folder on GitHub to test your program.
# For example:
#
# countedLetters = countLetters("da_vinci_code.txt");
# print("0 occured " + countedLetters["0"] + " times in the file.");
# print("1 occured " + countedLetters["1"] + " times in the file.");
# print("x occured " + countedLetters["x"] + " times in the file.");
# 
# Should print:
# 0 occured 3393 times in the file.
# 1 occured 3375 times in the file.
# x occured 3232 times in the file.
