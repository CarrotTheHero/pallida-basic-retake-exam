// Create a function that takes a sentence as an input, reverses the letters in every word (but not reverses the words order in the sentence), and returns the sentence with the reversed words.
// You shouldn't care about upper or lower case letters.
// Example:
//
// string reversedWords = WordReverser("lleW ,enod taht saw ton taht drah");
// Console.WriteLine(reversedWords);
//
// Should print:
// Well done, that was not that hard
